Currently learning basic html, html5, and css attributes on FreeCodeCamp!
It's a little confusing on some assignments, but once you get used to it, it gets easier.
I just finished the Build a Tribute Page test, with a little bit of help on Youtube.
I honestly need to take notes, because I did not know what I was doing despite completing the assignments.
I think I'm going to go to the FreeCodeCamp Youtube and watch a video of what I just learned and take notes.
